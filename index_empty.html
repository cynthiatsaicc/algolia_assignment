		<p>TextDear Cynthia Tsai, 

My name is Nicole Lu, a consultant from China International Intellectech Corporation (CIIC) which is the only state-owned company concentrating on Human Resources service in China. CIIC ranks No.10 by its 2016 revenue among Top 100 staffing firms globally.

CIIC cooperates closely with some other big state-owned companies to help with their senior talent introduction programs. I’m the consultant who specializes in the field of electronic technology, and have worked with China Electronic Technology Corporation (CETC) for a long time. CETC is a state-owned enterprise in China whose scope of business covers all fields in electronic information sector. For more info, please visit http://www.cetc.com.cn/. 

CETC plans to go to US this year to hold two talent communication forums, respectively in Los Angeles on Dec. 17 and San Francisco on Dec. 19. At the due time, the delegates from CETC including management leaders and technical experts will communicate with the talents attending the forum under a rather relaxing atmosphere. Keynote of the forum is to meet local talents and exchange opinions with them, so there are on strings attached. CETC is a quite internationalized corporation with Hikvision USA inc. being its most representative branch in US, and there are positions open in China and the States, fulltime and part-time as well. 

I’d like to invite you sincerely to attend the forums mentioned above. Really sorry for the short notice right before Christmas. Hope to get your feedback very soon!

Thank you and best regards,
Nicole Lu</p>
